## What is this?
This human user guide (HUG) exists thanks to [Technickel](https://github.com/Technickel-Dev) for introducing me to the talk given by [Alex Witherspoon](https://github.com/alexwitherspoon) to the [#DigitalAF](https://digitalaf.ca/) team in 2021. The purpose of this document is to introduce to the world what kind of person I am in order to humanize myself.  

## A Bit of Information About Me
I was raised in the region of Niagara Falls, but I moved to attend the University of Waterloo's Computer Engineering program. I love playing with new toys, which could be anything related to tech, sports, cars and dirt bikes. I spend a lot of my free time after work fixing old Honda dirt bikes from the 80s.

I had my first taste of programming after I joined an Introduction to Computer Science class in high school and ever since then, I have been very interested in pursuing a career in a field that requires programming. As to what specific field that is, I will just have to wait and see.

## Principles and Values
- Make sure you have good friends around you that you can help and that will also help you when in need
- Treat others how you would like to be treated
- Do not be stingy on people/things that matter
- Always try something before deciding whether you like it or not

## Tech Knowledge
I love working with tech, whether it be hardware, software or both. I find pleasure in discovering something new about tech. I find it very satisfying when developing software or making hardware that solves a real world problem. I receive a lot of pleasure by making something from scatch and giving it to someone important to me to see their reactions.

Here's a list of some of the tech I've used:
